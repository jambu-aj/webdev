			<h2>Leadership</h2>
			<h3>Technical Director, GT Web Dev</h3>
			<p> I give talks on a variety of web development topics, ranging from the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced topics like building and consuming RESTful web services and making SPA apps. I'm also heavily involved in curriculum development and planning for each semester's talks and events.</p>
			<h3>Cadet Commander, Aircraft Maintenance and Manufacturing Academy</h3>
			<p> I lead and organized a national week-long, residential academy that taught participants about aircraft manufacturing and maintenance on the live production floor. I managed, coordinated, and organized transportation, scheduling, activities, housing, meals, paperwork, special guests, press releases, and a plethora of other logistical tasks. The academy was very successful and lead to an award.</p>
