					<h3>Teleop Catalyst for ROBOTC</h3>
					<p class="small">Programming has never been easier.</p>
					<p>Tele-op Catalyst makes it stupidly easy to create robust teleop (remote control) programs for the FIRST Tech Challenge using a simple but powerful "click, command, create" workflow. With Catalyst, you can get your robot running in minutes, with little to no programming experience.</p>

			<h3>Technical Director, GT Web Dev</h3>
			<p> I give talks on a variety of web development topics, ranging from the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced topics like building and consuming RESTful web services and making SPA apps. I'm also heavily involved in curriculum development and planning for each semester's talks and events.</p>
			<h3>Cadet Commander, Aircraft Maintenance and Manufacturing Academy</h3>
			<p> I lead and organized a national week-long, residential academy that taught participants about aircraft manufacturing and maintenance on the live production floor. I managed, coordinated, and organized transportation, scheduling, activities, housing, meals, paperwork, special guests, press releases, and a plethora of other logistical tasks. The academy was very successful and lead to an award.</p>

			<h3>Tyler Tech - FedEx Day 2nd Place Winner</h3>
			<p>I developed a cross-platform, hybrid mobile application that leverages the powerful EnerGov RESTful API I worked on during the internship. I also developed an AngularJS directive that transforms tabular data into a fully responsive, touch friendly grid, complete with toggle controls and intelligent auto-switching based on screen size. Technologies used: JavaScript, AngularJS, Ionic Framework, Bootstrap, and LESS.</p>

			<h3>Preliminary acceptance to the SpaceX Internship Program</h3>
